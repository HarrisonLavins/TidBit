# TidBit

With an overwhelming variety of new articles published every day, absorbing information has become rather overwhelming in its unfiltered state. **_TidBit_** is an application made to help take away the overwhelming nature of the internet and filter it into digestible bite sized snippets tailored to the user.

TidBit is a microlearning mobile app that allows users to select categorical preferences that range in topics such as *Fitness, Technology, Languages, Culture, Fashion, Geography* and so on to provide users with brief snippets of information on a daily basis relating to their preferred topics. In the case that they overly enjoy the information read regarding the topic, the user can visit the source of the *Daily Topic* in order to learn more.
